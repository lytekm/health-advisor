# Health Advisor App (name pending)

This is a simple application for tracking your calories and macros based on your specific fitness goals.

## Features

### Macro and Calorie tracking

Scan foods and create meals for easy tracking of calories and macros throughout the day.

### Health Scoring

Foods you scan get a health score based on how good they are for you and how much they align with your current goals.

### Analytics

Analyze your eating habits over different time frame to find gaps in your nutrition.

### Excersise tracking

Track your excersise and create workout plans and goals for yourself.

### Management

This project is managed through Jira. All new features must be done in a new branch and tracked through Jira tasks.

### Key struggles

#### App setup

I set this project up from scratch basically and needed to change things within the config to allow for things like hot refresh and to switch to the app router. In this I learned more about how tsconfig works and overall just how to setup projects the way I want without a template.
